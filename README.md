# Flashcards-Plugin for DokuWiki

Converts some content into a set of scrollable/playable flashcards. Does NOT support the Internet Explorer!

## Usage

Enclose the flashcards with ``<cards>...</cards>``. The cards are separated with a horizontal line ``----``.

Example:

```
<cards>
First card
----
Second card
----
Third card
</cards>
```

## Issues / Ideas

* Improve scrolling / height settings
* Direct editing of the flashcards
